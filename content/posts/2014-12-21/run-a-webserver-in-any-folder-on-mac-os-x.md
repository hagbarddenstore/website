TL;DR;

How to host static files from commandline on Mac OS X using Python.

<!--more-->

### Problem:

Hosting HTML files in a proper webserver on Mac OS X without having to install
something like Apache HTTPD or nginx and configure. I want the simplest
solution to get this up and running.

### Solution:

Run the following snippet and you'll have a working HTTP server hosting your
static content on port 8000.

    cd /path/to/my/folder
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
